#Topologies and migration bands based on PhyloNet and TreeMix topologies. When These two methods differed in topologies, such as with Hypocnemis and Thamnophilus, the treemix topology was used

#Migration bands were added for any admixture events or reticulations indicated in PhyloNet and/or TreeMix and were added in both directions.
